Throughout history, landscape architects have utilized advanced technologies to aid the design process. Today, technological advancements have opened up new opportunities for UAVs and photogrammetry to produce high-resolution imagery, contours, and 3D models. By leveraging UAVs early in the design process, landscape architects are able to maximize advantages: site analysis through computational software, 3D sectional information, and hydrology prediction. This research focuses specifically on the advantages UAVs offer compared to established workflow methods. It examines four unique workflows for early-stage site documentation: capturing the site with UAVs through photogrammetry, generating a site plan from publicly available GIS data, gathering information from online vendors, and using google earth. The study evaluates each workflow across categories including cost, aerial imagery resolution, contour resolution, and user-friendliness. This study explores and analyzes results through the lens of small design firms, providing an understanding of UAV workflows in practice and academia.

CHAPTER I
LITURATURE REVIEW
Literature about Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is divided into several categories. First, there is the Literature about the historical development of these systems from their beginnings in the Military and armed forces through the further development and release of these systems to the public. This Literature is primarily historical and focuses less on application or technology. Secondly, a sample of the current application of UAVs in different fields is conducted. Here, the Literature identifies ways these systems enhance the day-to-day operations of various industries and professions. Third is Literature that covers the traditional field of Land surveying, giving an overview of the methods of analysis used.
Fourth, we cover the Literature discussing the methods that UAVs utilize to collect specialized data types, including photogrammetry and LiDAR, what these systems are, and how to deploy them, we will then cover the use of UAVs in Landscape Architecture. Here, we see how the technical and everyday advancements in UAVs enhance the design practice and replace traditional data collection methods. Finally, we cover the current market forces and players as of February 2025, acknowledging this technology's current policy and geopolitical stance and its impact on the focus of this study.



History
The History of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), often called "drones," is deeply rooted in military developments, particularly for surveillance and ordinance delivery. The term "drone" was first coined by Lieutenant Commander Delmar S. Fahrney in 1936, solidifying the Military's history in this field going forward (Zhang & Zhu, 2023). The first UAVs, such as the fabric balloon developed during World War I, laid the foundation for today's aerial technologies. While this first model was quite simple - using a wooden frame and hot air for lift - this early development paved the way for the advanced technology we now use for remote sensing and data collection (Meng et al., 2020). The Military's early development of UAVs allowed for the later expansion into civilian sectors, particularly those benefiting from similar systems.
As UAVs improved, the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) significantly improved the precision and usability of the devices, making them useful in various industries, including agriculture, environmental monitoring, and landscape architecture (Watanabe et al., 2017). This technological improvement allowed UAVs to capture high-quality images and spatial data through auto-location based on external reference points. This process transformed surveying and remote sensing (Tait et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2023). The use of these new sensors - along with others - helped operators evaluate and locate the health condition of vegetation, water content, and position, and the uses taking place on a site, all of which are necessary to enhance the effective use and control of the landscapes (Li et al., 2021). Additionally, the adaptability of the UAVs to use various sensors, such as multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, widens their use in different research fields (Cao, 2019).
As UAV technology was released to the public, researchers began exploring how it could be used in other disciplines, particularly land surveying and environmental monitoring. The ability of UAVs to capture high-resolution imagery and conduct remote sensing positions them as quality tools for surveying. The further development of positioning and sensing capabilities enables their application in land surveying, environmental monitoring, and wildlife census efforts. UAVs have already been successfully implemented in waterfowl population surveys, demonstrating their ability to minimize disturbance while acquiring data (McEvoy et al., 2016). This transition in UAVs has increased interest in their technical and operational abilities, prompting research into their design and functionality (Fust & Loos, 2020; Novotňák et al., 2024).
The increasing use of UAVs in landscape architecture promotes new methods of collecting and analyzing data, allowing professionals to collect previously unavailable data. According to various studies, the use of UAVs significantly improves the precision and efficiency in monitoring riparian vegetation and the evaluation of vegetation in vineyards (Sassu et al., 2021). Additionally, using UAVs in precision agriculture ensures the optimization of crop care through the detailed evaluation of the health and condition of plants and the ground using thermal imaging (Sassu et al., 2021). The versatility of using UAVs, alongside the improvement in sensor technologies, expands the use of UAVs in emerging applications, including air quality monitoring and disaster response (Erdelj & Natalizio, 2016). The future use and impact of UAV technology in various fields is almost impossible to predict, making research and technological improvement all the more essential to conduct.

Current Applications
The contemporary uses of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are diverse in light of their efficiency and versatility in various fields. In healthcare, UAVs are essential in delivering medical supplies, most notably in remote and isolated places. The use of UAVs to carry supplies, including life-sustaining drugs and blood specimens, has significantly minimized delivery time while improving the availability of healthcare services (Fotouhi et al., 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, UAVs were used in the contactless delivery of essential items, minimizing infection risks through minimized human contact (Leila et al., 2020). In addition to enhancing the healthcare supply chain, this use also helps solve logistical issues in emergency responses, showcasing the important position of UAVs in modern healthcare workflows.
UAVs also benefit search and rescue (SAR) tasks. The ability to conduct efficient surveys in large areas while providing real-time aerial imagery helps rescue personnel assess situations and track missing people more effectively (Hussain et al., 2024). When equipped with thermal imaging technology, UAVs can spot heat sources, making them incredibly useful for finding people in congested woods or disaster-struck zones (Abdallah, 2019). Additionally, using and integrating machine learning to guide UAV flight paths and spot possible victims makes SAR tasks more effective overall (Erdos et al., 2013). These applications result in quicker responses and higher rates of rescue success, making them necessary for SAR.
Modern military applications utilize UAVs as pivotal assets, particularly in surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat capabilities. Modern UAVs are equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and precision weaponry, allowing for targeted operations that minimize collateral damage (Sun et al., 2022). Their deployment has reshaped combat strategies, enabling forces to conduct intelligence-gathering and tactical operations without direct human risk (Kok & Rajendran, 2020). Furthermore, UAVs facilitate real-time monitoring of enemy movements and battlefield conditions, supplying commanders with critical data for strategic decision-making (Sun et al., 2022). As military technology advances, the reliance on UAVs for operational effectiveness and strategic superiority will only expand, making the continual development and implementation of these technologies a top priority for armed forces around the world.
Traffic management has also been completely transformed through real-time monitoring to enhance urban transit infrastructure. UAVs, equipped with high-quality cameras and other sensors, can monitor traffic patterns, traffic congestion, and accidents in real time (Vohra et al., 2022). The information gained through applications could be integrated into smart city infrastructure, enhancing traffic light coordination and overall efficiency (Hamurcu & EREN, 2021). One study highlights the aerial perspective gained by UAVs to determine large-scale traffic patterns, allowing for data-driven interventions by city planners to minimize congestion and accidents (Barmpounakis & Geroliminis, 2020). These developments are based on previous advances, building on the ability to gather and analyze traffic data at ever-increasing scales. Using UAVs in modern transportation planning helps construct safer and more efficient road networks.
UAVs are applied beyond the domains of professionals and governments and are being utilized in the entertainment industry. Their use in film has dramatically affected the world of cinematography by providing unique and dramatic camera angles, which were only accessible through resource-intensive helicopter applications (Bhandari et al., 2015). The increasing quality of cameras in UAVs helps filmmakers capture vast shots from unique directions, making the visuals and the content richer (Soni & Nachappa, 2022). Additionally, low-budget filmmakers can shoot quality content because of lower entry hurdles and required budgets (Bhandari et al., 2015; Soni & Nachappa, 2022). This progress is expected to provide opportunities for new developments in filmmaking.
In remote sensing, UAVs have streamlined environmental monitoring and data collection. UAVs with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors can capture detailed information on land use, vegetation health, and environmental changes (K. Lee et al., 2023). This capability is particularly valuable in precision agriculture, where UAVs assist farmers in monitoring crop health and optimizing resource allocation (H.-S. Lee et al., 2022). Additionally, UAVs play a crucial role in disaster assessment and relief efforts. Researchers can quickly gather data on affected areas and inform response efforts without boots on the ground (Abdallah, 2019). Integrating UAVs into remote sensing practices enhances the efficiency and accuracy of data collection while allowing for more considerable land coverage with fewer workers. These fields are enhanced by the incorporation of UAVs into professional workflows.

Land surveying
Land surveying improved greatly through the use of remote sensing. Technology has transformed the field in numerous ways. Old techniques, such as triangulation, leveling, and traversing, were used to make maps and determine the borders of the land. Triangulation calculates the angles between the points, and from the angles, calculates the distance between the points. This process has been employed in making maps and subdividing lots (De Smedt et al., 2014, 2022). Leveling measures the difference in elevation from a known point and is handy for building, construction, and civil engineering (Joel & Oguanobi, 2024). Traversing calculates the distance and the angles between lines and assists in making site plans. UAVs with the correct technology streamline these traditional methods by incorporating automation and implementing these three processes simultaneously.
The advancement in geological survey techniques significantly improved the methods used in data collection, making thorough and non-destructive investigations into subsurface conditions possible. The use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity (ER), and magnetometry allows for non-invasive or destructive subsurface surveying (De Smedt et al., 2014). These techniques greatly enhance archaeological and geological research, where the need to understand subsurface conditions intersects with preserving delicate artifacts. GPR determines the position and location of buried objects using light, while magnetometry detects the differences in magnetism, indicating a change in material for potential deposits of artifacts (Neal, 2004). Surveyors can gather detailed data through these techniques, improving precision land evaluations while minimizing workforce requirements.
UAV technology transformed the process of surveying, particularly in acquiring aerial data. High-quality cameras and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) allow UAVs to acquire accurate topography over vast territories (Draeyer & Strecha, 2014). This technology is critical in developing detailed 3D models and high-quality maps useful in urban planning, environmental observation, and landscape architecture (Liu, 2008). Additionally, the use of UAV-based surveying minimizes risks from adverse climatic conditions by conducting the operation at a distance, reducing risks associated with ground surveys (Jain & Jagtap, 2023). Using UAV and geological survey equipment marks a significant milestone in undertaking land surveys, making it easier and less problematic to conduct.

UAV Data Collection
The technical ability of UAVs has seen tremendous progress and development since their first applications in defense. This progress comes mainly in imagery, photogrammetry, and LiDAR. Currently, high-quality cameras on UAVs can capture detailed images from above. These images are used in diverse applications ranging from monitoring the environment to aiding in urban planning. Integrating these images into various workflows allows for generating highly detailed ortho-perspective maps and accurately referencing 3D models (Gevaert et al., 2018; Serrat et al., 2020). The improvement in the quality of the data these cameras capture continues to provide diverse applications, the limiting factor being the camera (Serrat et al., 2020). Timelapse, Augmented Reality (AR), and Virtual Reality (VR) are some of the emerging uses for UAVs, moving us closer to the reality of full-scale holograms (Kemppinen et al., 2020).
Photogrammetry, the scientific process of extracting measurements from images, has received significant advances through UAVs. UAVs equipped with Photogrammetric cameras capture a sequence of overlapping images varying in direction, which enables post-processing software to stitch together accurate 3D models or ortho-topographic images of the environment. These capabilities rely on powerful post-processing software often available through subscriptions (Dayal & Chauhan, 2018; Matese et al., 2015). This method has significant implications in the agricultural community, most significantly for crop monitoring and evaluation. It also has implications in the construction world by allowing for detailed site evaluation and analysis. The ability of photogrammetry to capture large quantities of data at ease increases efficiency and advances decision-making during the design and construction processes. The most significant limitation of photogrammetry is model resolution, which significantly depends on the post-processing software applied (Gevaert et al., 2018).
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) signifies a major and significant improvement in the area of UAV technology. Using LiDAR technology by UAVs allows for the collection of 3D data, including terrain and vegetation, with stunning precision. The generation of high-quality topographic maps and detailed landscape analysis allows for more accurate and informed decision-making for surveyors (Puliti et al., 2020; Su et al., 2024). This technology is helpful in forestry and environmental research because it can penetrate biomass with greater precision and generate highly accurate analyses. Additionally, integrating LiDAR and UAV technology increases precision and allows for implementation in remote or hard-to-reach areas, increasing the range of applications (Puliti et al., 2020). These technologies are already being used to significant effect in the Amazon rainforest (Khan et al., 2017). The possibilities of this technology mean that we will continue to see an increase in applications across all fields. 
Software also plays a critical role in the application of UAVs, particularly for Photogrammetry and LiDAR post processing (Baqersad et al., 2017). Software for post processing varies on accuracy determinable on use cases (Dai & Lu, 2010). Pix4D, PhotoMod, and Agisoft PhotoScan are all powerful photogrammetry software with specialized applications (Niethammer et al., 2012). Pix4D mapper offers a more precise generalized and user-friendly option, while PhotoMod and Agisoft PhotoScan are more specialized and technical (Niethammer et al., 2012). Overall, software developments are improving in accuracy and becoming more accessible with further innovation in the field. 

UAVs in Landscape Architecture
Landscape architecture has increasingly adopted UAV technology, particularly in site analysis, imaging, and construction oversight. UAVs equipped with photogrammetry, LiDAR, and multispectral sensors now play an increasing role in data collection for informed site planning and design. Generating comprehensive topographical maps allows UAV-enabled landscape architects to understand landforms, vegetation patterns, and site conditions more accurately, supporting data-driven or parametric designs (Alsamarraie et al., 2022). Additionally, the ability of UAVs to monitor long-term environmental change allows professionals to document site conditions before and after project implementation—a critical factor in evaluating the effectiveness of landscape interventions (K. Lee et al., 2023).
Construction administration utilizes UAVs to enhance project monitoring by providing real-time images to verify progress and compliance with design specifications. The everyday use of UAVs to monitor the site encourages collaboration among all parties. Project managers can also check that construction is carried out with attention to design intentions (Alsamarraie et al., 2022; Javaid et al., 2021). UAVs also streamline project management across larger sites by offering autonomous flight paths and data collection. UAVs also allow for the location and solution to problems that may arise in the construction process, such as construction hazards or unplanned modifications (Javaid et al., 2021; Sapirstein, 2016). The integration of UAV technology into construction and design not only benefits construction administration but also the general quality of the project.
Beyond construction administration and site analysis, UAVs are essential in conservation. Multispectral sensors allow UAVs to assess the health of plants, recognize biodiversity patterns, and monitor data necessary to inform ecological restoration (K. Lee et al., 2023). Research has shown the efficiency of UAVs in monitoring urban landscapes, where aerial data helped landscape architects locate intervention zones and develop specific management strategies (Videras Rodríguez et al., 2021). Additionally, UAVs enhance community involvement by providing dynamic visuals of proposed designs, increasing understanding and client feedback (Meyer-Lorey & Acabado, 2024). This function is helpful in public projects, where visualization helps gather community feedback and increase understanding of community involvement.
Case studies of UAVs in landscape architecture focus on the shifting perspective played by low altitude aerial observations. Opportunities to develop more comprehensive and more valuable understandings of site, scale, and existing conditions are enhanced by the use of UAVs in landscape architecture (Kullmann, 2018). In addition to the quantitative benefits and capabilities of UAVs, the qualitative aspect creates new avenues of design and exploration (Kullmann, 2014). UAVs offer a changing perspective of the landscape that surveys to enhance the landscape architects’ workflows and methods (Maghazei et al., 2022).

Design Process 
Landscapes are a composite of the strata that make them up, including but not limited to: environmental systems, human systems, and cultural systems (Arnold & Wade, 2015). These composite strata create the central core of the landscape understanding, being central systems of the landscape (Booth, 1989). The syntheses of these strata form the core of landscape architectural inventory and analysis (Ozyavuz, 2012). Not only are these systems central to landscape architectural understanding but they reflect the very essence of landscape itself (McHarg, 1995).
	Logical categorization of landscape architectural design divides the process into four broad categories: Site Inventory and Analysis, Conceptual Design, Design Development, and Project Implementation (LaGro, 2011). These categories serve to inform the work and methods used in each phase, allowing for a comprehensive and exhaustive workflow to be employed. Observations of what is, shapes the beginning phases, while increasing precision and justification of construction dominate the latter two (Çelik, 2014). 
	Environmental, human, and cultural systems leave marks on the landscape that can be observed and documented. While there are many specific workflows for documenting nuanced data, there are staples that still carry significant weight in the inventory process (Grieco & Mingozzi, 2023; Ozyavuz, 2012). The aerial image has seen a rise in supremacy since the invention of the satellite, owing to the nature of the near-orthographic captures (Duttmann et al., 2020). Additionally, with the rise of the digital model a greater emphasis continues to be placed on 3D mapping and remote sensing technologies (Amoroso, 2010). Within these two central artifacts of site analysis, most physical elements of a site can be inventoried. 
	
Market and Policy
Numerous models and manufacturers dominate the UAV market. The models are tailored to provide specialized recreational, commercial, and industrial applications. The major market players, Parrot, Skydio, and DJI, control the recreational and commercial markets. However, DJI stands apart based on cutting-edge technology and consumer-oriented models, with the Mavic and Phantom lines more widely used in aerial photography and video in part due to price (Maghazei & Netland, 2019; Waris et al., 2022). Parrot, by comparison, holds a more significant market share in the agricultural market through the use of the Anafi USA, applying thermal imagery to monitor crop health and perform environmental assessments (AI-Hajj et al., 2022). Skydio, meanwhile, excels through the use of autonomous flying, making it a preferred solution in the construction and public security industries, in applications requiring flying through intricate landscapes (AI-Hajj et al., 2022; Maghazei & Netland, 2019).
In addition to the established businesses, new specialized businesses constantly emerge, developing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) custom-designed for different unique applications. Among the businesses are Zipline and Wing, focusing on delivering medical supplies through drones to deliver necessary items to isolated regions (Jeyabalan et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2023). Businesses such as senseFly and AgEagle offer specialized drones custom-designed to support precision agriculture, helping farmers monitor crop health and increase yields (AI-Hajj et al., 2022; Oliveira et al., 2023). Combined, the businesses enhance the competitive nature of the manufacturing industries, driving technological improvement and making UAVs accessible and cheaper for recreational and commercial use (Goh et al., 2017; Shoval, 2016).
Without addressing the current political climate on these technologies, no discussion of the current conditions surrounding UAVs would be complete. Concerns surrounding Chinese-manufactured drones, particularly DJI, have prompted heightened scrutiny in the United States. Concerns over national security and data privacy have prompted the U.S. government to investigate potential risks posed by DJI drones, due to their data collection capabilities (Hwang & Kim, 2019; Pauschinger & Klauser, 2020). In 2020, the Department of Defense designated DJI as a potential security risk, leading to federal agencies' restrictions on the use of its UAVs (Hwang & Kim, 2019). This development aligns with growing geopolitical tensions towards foreign technology firms, particularly those in China, leading to more regulatory oversight (Maghazei et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2020).
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has long been involved in overseas manufacturers' regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In response to similar security concerns, the FAA has pushed to impose tighter control on the importation and use of drones by manufacturer DJI (Pauschinger & Klauser, 2020). In response, many businesses opened investigations into other manufacturers, diverting investments into local UAV manufacturers to offset the risks associated with offshoring (Hwang & Kim, 2019; Maghazei et al., 2022). This narrative continues to reflect the nuanced challenge of balancing security concerns and the modalities of policymaking and technological developments.
Regulation of day-to-day operations of UAVs is also overseen by the FAA to maintain safe operating conditions for pilots and bystanders. These regulations include strict license and operating requirements, with manual reporting for any deviations from standard operating procedures(Wallace et al., 2017). Operation of a UAV requires possession of a Part 107 Remote Pilots license, which requires passing a FAA section test. These requirements limit the number of licensed remote pilots and restrict access to UAV workflows.


Problem Statement

This literature review examines the historical development and current applications of UAVs. While existing literature highlights the technical capabilities of UAVs, few texts directly address the role of UAVs in landscape architectural workflows. In particular, the literature overlooks how these improvements can be adopted into everyday site inventory process. 
This study bridges the gap between research on UAVs and professional landscape architecture firm workflows. This study leverages existing knowledge on UAV capabilities and applies it to current workflows to understand how practice might change. 
The methodology and approach of this study are designed to answer the following research question:
How can UAVs improve site analysis workflows for small landscape architecture firms?




 
CHAPTER II
METHODOLOGY
To carry out this research, two methods were used to determine the speed and quality of sUAVs (small unmanned aerial vehicles) for small-sized landscape architecture firms. The first method utilized a survey that created a baseline understanding of how small landscape architecture firms are currently understanding site conditions, see appendix a. To understand how they are mapping and modeling site-specific data in the early stages of the design process. This survey focused on the data acquisition workflows that firms use, with a particular interest in sequential processes. The survey contained twenty-six questions and was distributed by email in the southeastern United States.  The survey sought to capture information about these firms' workflows. Particularly, the tools and techniques employed, and the application of those outputs.
The second method analyzed the common approaches for capturing base site information. These were then compared with the use of UAVs and related software for capturing similar site data in the design process. This method covered the range of practices currently used by professionals in an attempt to set a benchmark. This benchmark was then compared with sUAVs to understand the comparative advantages and disadvantages of their use. Both measures were compared to a professional survey for accuracy, as the professional survey is the industry standard for the most accurate method for site information. 
Survey of Professional Tools and Techniques for Capturing Site Data:
The first method used was the survey. The survey was divided into ten categories, which were chosen to help group information together by workflow stages. Category 01 in the survey focused on creating a base understanding of the organization or individual that responded. All the control variables were located in this section to be held constant during analysis. Organization type, size, typical projects, and computer systems were located in this section, allowing these variables to be held consistent across the rest of the data. The questions in this section were designed to help determine if some tools were being used in different sections of the industry or across different computer systems. 
Category 02 contains one question: “Please indicate which resources your organization uses to gather site information; mark all that apply.” This question was one of the most important throughout the survey, as it told us what tools are currently being used by professionals in the field. Questions and categories located after this one asked follow-up questions for further understanding of the answers to this question. Options were: Google Earth/Maps, GIS (publicly available data), Nearmap, UAVs, Professional survey, and options for “other”. Follow-up questions sought to understand what phases of the design process each tool is used for. This information built a matrix of programs and phases that allowed us to identify what tools were being used and for what phases of a project. This allowed us to identify any gaps or overlaps in current workflows

The survey was distributed to licensed landscape architects in the southeastern United States. The survey was distributed using a departmental email list as well as through state ASLA chapters. Chapter presidents and vice presidents were contacted and asked to distribute the survey to chapter members. These chapter presidents and vice presidents were identified through the ASLA website. Each respondent from the mailing list received an email requesting participation in the study, see appendix b. Chapter presidents were sent an email asking for help in distributing a request, see appendix b. By reaching out to these people, we were able to capture a diverse network of responses that gave us a better cross-section of current practices. The geographic location focused on the southeast. 
Results were analyzed using Qualtrics, a statistical analysis software. The categories were put into a matrix and cross-referenced with the phases of design. Results were also weighted to represent the most commonly used tools for site analysis. These steps helped identify what, if any, gaps exist in the current professional workflows. This survey research followed up on previous work that studied what programs were being used in professional practice. Paired together, we were able to understand what programs, analysis tools, and techniques firms are using, and for what phases of the design process. This provided insight into where the use of UAVs might increase speed or quality of the process. This also allowed us to hone the scope of the UAV workflows that were studied and developed, leading to more targeted and helpful research. 
This study was approved by Mississippi State University’s Institutional Review Board and Human Research Protection Program for the protection of all participants. It was granted an exemption determination due to the nature of the study. Two hundred fifty-three respondents were reached out to through the emailing list, while thirteen-chapter presidents and vice presidents were contacted. All individuals were informed of the study, its nature, and the time required. All responses were voluntary. In total 54 individuals responded.

Site for Comparative Analysis:
The site selected for this study is located at the intersection of University Dr. and Jarnigan St. in Starkville, MS (33°27'36"N 88°48'26"W). The site is located on two different city parcels, both of which are owned by UNIVERSITY JARNAGIN LLC. The site is a total of 0.51 acres. It is located next to Odd Fellows Cemetery and Scooter’s record shop, in the northeastern part of the state of Mississippi. This region sits in the Blackland Prairie ecoregion of the state.
This site was selected to offer both a challenge and an opportunity for the sUAV site analysis method. This is due to the features of the site. The site has a rolling topography that creates a complex contour signature. Parking and buildings also affect the contour signature of the site due to building pads and grading principles of parking design. The site sits on the corner of a major and minor roadway, because of this there are swales stormwater runoff infrastructure. These affect the topography of the site. 
The site also contains some underground and overhead utilities that cross over the lot. These create an opportunity for understanding the capabilities of each tool to gather accurate information regarding unique site conditions. Some utilities also have structures that indicate their location underground. 
Vegetation also plays a role in shaping the site selected for this study. The location of trees, shrubs, and other plants creates a diverse condition on the site. Most of the site is developed; therefore, the vegetation is intentionally located across the site. However, there is a part of the site in the back that remains much more “natural” in appearance. Here, the vegetation is denser and varies in plant type and species. Most of the site is covered in lawn grass, creating a small range of planting types. There are several large trees that dominate the middle of the site. The character of the vegetation cross-section offers several types of typical conditions one might find on any given site. 
This site was appropriate for the study due to the list of site conditions previously mentioned. Additionally, the site is owned by a private organization that gave me permission to use it in my study. The conditions of the site created a unique series of opportunities for any of the site analysis tools to show their strengths, as well as test their potential weaknesses. Because of the site's remote location in Starkville, MS, aerial information is less frequently updated. This allowed us to see the comparison of freely available stagnant data to real-time dynamic conditions. The variation in both topography and vegetation allowed us to understand how each site analysis tool deals with varying conditions. It also provided data on which conditions each one performs the best in. This became important in determining whether sUAVs are able to increase either the quality or speed of the design process.

Comparison of the Capture Techniques:
In conjunction with the Survey of Professional Tools and Techniques for Capturing Site Data, a site was selected, and analysis was conducted for it using traditional tools. Analysis tools included: Google Earth/Maps, GIS (publicly available data), Nearmap, sUAV, and a licensed professional survey. The data collected from these methods was then sorted into two categories, artifacts and data. These tools were then compared across the categories to analyze effectiveness. The artifacts consisted of aerial images and 3D models. Aerial imagery was compared using a combination of pixel resolution in cm, visual identification, and projection warping. These three criteria were studied in Adobe Photoshop for ease of use and analysis. 3D models were compared using a combination of contour resolution in feet, sectional accuracy, and vegetation clarity. Data contained all of the information needed to inform design decisions, these included: contours, utilities, objects, buildings, and vegetation. These categories of data were compared in Rhino 3D to measure distances from the professional survey. Data points were located and then compared across the different tools. 
Existing Techniques for Capturing Site Data:
	Based on the information gathered in the literature and confirmed in the survey, several methods of capturing site data were selected and tested. These methods used tools that will be referred to as resources throughout. Resources were selected for study due to the number of responses in the survey and number of mentions in the literature. 
Google Earth/Maps
Google Earth or Google Maps is one of the standard industry information-gathering resources. It is free to use and intuitive to figure out. The aerial imagery that it uses ranges in quality, with some historical data available in certain locations. As the flagship mapping company, Google's geospatial information is one of the most extensive repositories. Google’s use of low-Earth orbit satellites for the generation of aerial imagery creates some problems for resolution and projection. However, the use of satellites does allow for a longevity of imagery that gave us a view into the past. This historical information can be helpful when considering the significance of a site. Additionally, Google Earth data is updated 1 to 12 times a year, potentially providing updated information.
Using Google Earth, the site was manually observed for data visible in the mapping program, like above-ground utilities and tree cover. An aerial image was then generated of the site using the highest resolution as a color image and plotted into a base 24x36 digital file. Google Earth Pro was also used to look at historical data of the site that might show up in the imagery bank. This included older structures, vegetation, transit infrastructure, along with other items of interest. The aerial imagery was then analyzed in Adobe Photoshop to determine accuracy and visual identification. 
State and National GIS Repositories (MARIS, ATLAS, etc.)
Many states offer freely available data that can be used by engineers and surveyors through a GIS application. The quality and type of information available vary from state to state and even county to county, with some offering more applicable data than others. Due to this, the value of this research tool varies greatly based on location. At the national level, some freely available data helps to fill in the gaps that some states might have, but it is also not a completely exhaustive list of site conditions. Therefore, this tool is highly regionally dependent. MARIS (Mississippi Automated Research Information System) has a high-quality and decently extensive database. 
Using the online GIS database provided by MARIS, the site was analyzed with a focus on contours, utilities, structures, building footprints, and vegetation. Available datasets were loaded into QGIS, a free and open-source GIS interface—and used to generate aerial imagery and 3D models. The 2D generated information, including contours, utilities, objects, buildings, and vegetation was then charted in Rhino 3D to make accurate comparisons with other aerial images. The 3D information gathered through QGIS was then loaded into Rhino 3D and used to create a base 3D model of the site. This model was then used to test the accuracy of the 3D-generated information in comparison to the professional survey.
Online Vendors
High-quality aerial imagery is a crucial aspect of modern-day mapping techniques. Extensive literature covers the transition from ground-based perspective mapping through the gradual rise to low-Earth orbit satellite mapping. The angle and projection of top-down maps pose challenges when transitioning from satellite imagery to real-world geospatial points. Here, the use of high-resolution mapping offers more identifiable and accurate information. Utilizing fixed-wing UAVs with more powerful cameras allows for higher-quality aerial imagery. Combined with the ability to ortho-reference these images, modern aerial imagery is more accurate and applicable than ever as a site information tool. 
Nearmap - a third-party imaging company that generates high-resolution aerial imagery - offers one of the best options for gathering current imagery. Using this company's products, an aerial image was generated for the site using the highest quality to compare with the other aerial images. The aerial was also inspected for data regarding contours, utilities, structures, building footprints, and vegetation. The data collected from Nearmap is gathered from a fixed-wing UAV flown at low altitudes to gather current high-quality data and is updated 1-2 times a year.
Topoexport was used to generate a 3D model of the site as an artifact for analysis. The information and data available in Topoexport are varied depending on the scale of the site in question. Additionally, for some locations supplemental data about vegetation, tree location, and wind studies may be generated. For the site of this study no additional data was available beyond the base model capabilities. This model was then loaded into Rhino 3D to compare the slope, location, and material mapping against other models gathered. 
Licensed Professional Survey
As the gold standard of site analysis, the professional survey was used as the benchmark for all other tools used in this research. When comparing the viability of site information for a project, the relationship to the professional survey is critical in analyzing the effectiveness of a method. Because this is the metric used by contractors in the field, it is the most accurate measure of how a project gets built. Therefore, using a professional survey as the baseline for all the measures of analysis allowed us to test the usefulness to the professional workflow. Likely, a method of site analysis that is close enough to the professional survey would require little to no modifications to the design. Saving time and money for both the firm and the owner. 
For the site selected, we used a professional survey to provide the baseline. A professional survey was conducted for the site in question and used to generate a 2D site map, a 3D model, and a list of data for the site. Information contained in the survey data included contours, utilities, structures, building footprints, and vegetation. The information gathered in this way was then used as the control for the study.
Current UAV workflows for capturing site data:
The method of using sUAVs to capture various aspects of the site remained the same across all categories of data.  sUAV flights were carried out around noon in overcast conditions to minimize sun shadow distortion for both aerial imagery and photogrammetry. Flights were conducted using a DJI Mavic 2 Pro to test an affordable, user-friendly sUAV option, most suitable for small landscape architecture firms. Flights were programmed using Pix4Dcapture in a double-gridded flight path covering the site twice. Flights used the same settings throughout, chosen for accuracy and efficiency: altitude = 40m, angle = -60 degrees, overlap 80%, and a speed of 2.7 m/s. The data captured by the UAV was then run through a photogrammetry program to compare results: Pix4D pro. This program was used to generate both aerial imagery and 3D point-cloud models of the site. Aerial imagery was compared to the other imagery using Adobe Photoshop, while the 3D models was loaded into Rhino 3D to compare the accuracy of 3D modeling data. Both the imagery and the 3D models were then analyzed in comparison to the professional survey for accuracy and information generated. 
Criteria for comparison between site capture techniques:
Pixel resolution is a key part of the analysis process for aerial imaging, as seen in the literature. Most images we interact with are a type of rasterized image. This means that it relies on a series of pixels to represent the graphic element. This is done by imposing a grid onto the image and assigning each square of the grid a hue, tone, and saturation value that approximates the image. These squares (pixels) combine to create an overall image. The resolution of an image is determined by how small each pixel of the grid is. The smaller the pixel, the more accurately the image represents real life. 
To analyze the aerial imagery generated by the tools of this study, we compared the resolution of the images using pixels. The overall pixel count was less helpful for us due to the variation in the scale of the image. Therefore, we used a comparison to cm. This is a standard method of comparing image resolution. Here we measured each pixel to see how many cm it was for each of the different tools of aerial imaging. This was done by taking the length of a known element in the image and measuring the number of pixels that made it up. Doing so in each image gave us image resolution in pixels. This quantitative measure then allowed us to compare and analyze the quality of each tool’s ability to capture high-resolution aerial imagery. 
Visual Identification
Visual identification can be closely tied to image resolution, but it focuses less on the technical and quantitative information stored in the image and more on perception. Aerial imagery is ultimately a photograph of the Earth taken from above; as such, being able to correctly identify the contents of the image is of great importance. For several of the ancillary categories of information, the only way to identify them remotely is to do so visually. This is true for some utilities as well as structures. Here, the ability to visually identify certain site-specific features was tested across the different tools. 
Each image was assessed on the ability of an individual to identify key site features. A list of features was positively identified from each aerial image, and these lists were then compared. This showed where visual identification was strongest among the site tools used. These lists were then verified by on-site observations and referenced to the professional survey. This ensured the accuracy of the identification, with each positive and negative identification weighed to provide a qualitative analysis between the tools. 
As noted in the literature, material mapping and visual information is a major strength of digital modeling applications. Therefore, 3D models were analyzed for visual data and clarity. Models were loaded into Rhino 3D and compared using a rendered viewport. This revealed material information, as well as other visual data such as shadows. This data was then cataloged for each resource to create an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each. Finaly visual information was compared to onsite observation to analyze accuracy. 
Quantitative Measures 
The location of existing data was compared across the tools with the professional survey to measure the accuracy of location. Here, the location of each type of data category was mapped onto overlays, which allowed for measuring center to center to identify the most accurate tool for gauging the location of each data type on site. This provided both a standard deviation in feet for each tool, as well as a directional warp due to projection style. 
Each unique type of data was analyzed in Rhino 3D and plotted to an accurate site location. Plotted points were color coded for each resource used. By overlaying these plotted points with the professional survey, the distance from each point to the corresponding point on professional survey was able to be measured. These measurements then provided the closest, furthest, and average deviation from the professional survey for precision. 
Each category was measured separately to reduce visual confusion and provide a logical framework for the study. Data was measured in order: contours, slopes, utilities, objects, buildings, and finally vegetation. 
Vegetation is a hard category to measure in the site information phase of the project. This is due to the fine grain of the leaves that throw off and obscure the visual line of sight. However, as a landscape architect, it is important to understand the existing vegetation on the site. Its location and quality/condition can change the design intentions of a landscape architect. Therefore, the ability to correctly understand the vegetation on a site is critical for the site analysis process. Here, overall massing and individual vegetation samples were measured to assess each tool's ability to enhance the understanding of the site. 



 
CHAPTER III
RESULTS


The results are divided into a series of sections that correlate to the process in which the methods were carried out.

Survey questionnaire results 
The survey received several responses that directed the course of the project. The number and type of respondents directly affected the collected data. The results are split into different categories of information. The overall number of respondents was 54.


Figure 1	
Tools Used

*Open text entry 


What software or tools are the respondents using to work with site data and information? The most important resource identified by respondents was the professional survey. One hundred percent of respondents (54) said that they use a professional survey for understanding a site. This section also saw Google Earth/Google Maps as a secondary method of gathering data. Ninety-two percent of respondents said that they use it as a resource for gathering site information. After the professional survey and Google Earth, the next step was GIS. Here, 77% of respondents indicated that they use this resource. These resources ranked highest, all receiving over fifty percent of responses. 
The next few resources that were used all fall below 40%. The category - other (1), which is divided into multiple short form responses, placed the next highest. Some of the short-form answers included: “field measurements, site visit, and historical documents.” This category, once broken out into the specific responses, falls much further down the chart in terms of use. After this, we see UAVs with 33% of respondents using them as a method for understanding a site. This is important for the sake of this thesis, as this is the main method that we are trying to understand in relation to other resources for gathering information. 
Nearmap, an online aerial imaging vendor, was the next most used, with only 13% of respondents using this resource for data. Then two “other” categories. These results indicate that there is a main divide in the resources analyzed in this research between more common resources and less common resources. 
Among the more common resources, we have the first three resources discussed: professional survey, Google Earth, and GIS. These three had a majority response in the survey above 75%. This indicates that these are the most common methods of gathering data about a site. Respondents indicated that they were more familiar with these resources and used them with significantly higher volume than the other resources. 
Among the less common resources, we have the rest: UAVs, Nearmap, field measurements, historical documents, and site visits. These resources all fall below 35%, and if we remove UAVs from that list, they fall below 25%. This leaves a clear gap in the middle percentages that is not covered. Indicating that resources are either widely used and understood in the field of Landscape Architecture, or they are fairly used and not understood. With little to no middle ground. 

Categorization of artifacts and data
Additionally, for each resource that was included in the study, participants were asked to indicate what artifacts/data they gathered from it. This information was sorted into categories. Below are the results of each resource.


Figure 2	
Data Categorization Workflow
 


Figure 2 shows the categories of data and artifacts that were studied for each of the resources. 

Figure 3	
Professional Survey Results
 
Note. This figure shows the results of the professional survey.


The professional survey respondents indicated that they primarily use it to acquire data about the site. Utilities, Structures, Building Footprints, Contours, and Vegetation all rank extremely high in the results, with response rates above 84%. There is a dramatic fall off for the two artifacts, only coming in at 34% and 25% respectively. This data is consistent with what we could expect from the professional survey, given how high it falls in the case of uses. Respondents listed the professional survey as the most used resource, with a special focus on the accuracy of the data that it can deliver. 


Figure 4	
Google Earth Results
 
Note. This figure shows the results for Google Earth.


Google Earth has a different focus in the survey, with respondents indicating that they primarily use it for aerial imagery of the site. This is in line with what we might expect based on the main purpose of what Google Earth is: a satellite imagery mapping tool. The other major data types were building footprints, vegetation, and structures. These all fall above 59%, while the rest of the data types are significantly lower, with none rising above a 30% response rate. Additionally, the total number of responses that indicated that Google Earth was a resource that they used indicates its ease of use. The most prominent data that people gather from Google Earth is visually verifiable. The location of structures or vegetation is easily seen from an overhead aerial. While Google Earth can certainly provide this type of information, it is also equipped to provide more detailed site information, however, most people do not use it in this way. Overall, Google Earth is an intuitive resource for gathering information based on an aerial image, and this is what most respondents use it for.


Figure 5	
GIS Results
 
Note. This figure shows the results for GIS


GIS is the second most used resource indicated in the survey. The type of data that is gathered from GIS looks different from the other graphs that we have seen so far. This is because here the relationship of the graph is linear. While with Google Earth, there were clearly defined changes in the number of respondents who collected certain data, with GIS, it is a more gradual drop-off. Respondents showed that the most acquired data is Utilities. 82% of respondents use GIS for Utilities data. However, 79% of respondents use GIS for contour data, and 68% use it for aerial imagery. These numbers are a lot closer than any of the other resources included in this study. This trend continues with the rest of the data types. Both structures and building footprints received a 53% response rate, while vegetation received 41%. This linear response rate shows that GIS is a versatile and powerful resource in collecting site data, and that professionals recognize this potential and use it accordingly. GIS is also practically tied for having the highest floor, meaning that the least used data is significantly higher than other resources. The only other resource that matches it in this way is the UAV. 


Figure 6	
Online Vendor Results
 
Note. This figure shows the results for Online Vendors.


With the Online vendor Nearmap, it closely mirrors Google Earth. 100% of respondents use it to gather aerial imagery about a site, with a significant drop-off in the other types of data. The next most prominent types are the same three that were indicated with Google Earth: vegetation, building footprints, and structures. Here, there is a tie between the first two while structures received fewer responses, again mirroring the graph for Google Earth. The most significant difference between the two is the category of contours, for Nearmap less than 1% of respondents indicated that they use it to collect contour data, which is a significant change from the 30% who use Google Earth in this way. Once again, this is in line with what one might expect from an online mapping vendor focused on aerial imagery and enhanced mapping tools. 


Figure 7	
UAV Results
 
Note. This figure shows the results for UAVs


UAVs have one of the steadiest response rates with a very strong grouping around the 50% mark. The most collected type of data is aerial imagery, however, among the other types of data, UAVs have a small dispersion. One of the most important differences for UAVs is the collection of 3D model data. 67% of respondents gather 3D models from a UAV. This is a significantly higher number than any of the other resources included in this study. The professional survey is the next closest when it comes to collecting 3D models. Utilities is the least collected data type, and it still received 33% of respondents, which gives UAVs the highest floor of the resources included in this study. This indicates that out of the number of people using UAVs for data collection, there is a high number who understand the full range of applications available. 
All the resources included in this study are being utilized for the collection of some type of data by current respondents. Each resource has a single or set of data types that people rely on for more heavily than other resources. For utilities, respondents lean on professional surveys and GIS, while for aerial imagery, other resources are turned to. The professional survey is heavily relied upon for all of the data categories but is less used for the artifacts. While for UAVs, that is slightly shifted with more of a focus on the artifacts and supplemental data. Nearmap and Google Earth focus primarily on aerial imagery, while respondents also use Google Earth for some types of data collection. 

Cross Analysis 

Figure 8	
PC/Mac Cross Analysis
 
Note. This figure shows the cross analysis of resources with operating systems.


In addition to the raw numerical response data there are a few interesting cross analyses. First, there is no major difference between the resources used to gather site data and the operating system being used. There are some small idiosyncrasies with the professional survey being less used in conjunction with Mac, while the rest of the resources received higher response rates. While these differences are noticeable, the statistical significance is week, suggesting that there is no strong correlation.


Figure 9	
Small/Large Firm Cross Analysis
 
Note. This figure show the cross analysis of resources with firm size.


Secondly, firm size has a significant relationship with resources used. Small firms use GIS more than large firms, with a statistically significant relationship. Inversely, small firms use UAVs less than large firms. This indicates that there are differences in the resources that are being used correlating to size of the organization. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that there is a lack of adoption of UAV technology for small firms. There is no indication in this study of why that might be. Nore is there any indication of why small firms are more likely to use GIS.
For each resource, there is a clear hierarchy of how practicing landscape architects and design professionals are using it in the real world. The survey works well to provide a benchmark to understand what the current use patterns are. But it does nothing to tell us if these are the best uses for these tools. This is where the next part of the method comes into play. The case study.
Case study introduction.

The case study was conducted to test the real-world application of each resource as a site information collection tool. The site that was studied was 518 University Drive, Starkville, MS 39759. Each tool was utilized on the site to understand the type and quality of the data and artifacts collected. 
Each tool was tested based on the matrix determined from the survey. Because of the nature of the study, the professional survey was held constant as the most accurate information available. This is because it is the gold standard of construction and is used to build off of for any project. Therefore, each resource was compared for accuracy against the professional survey in each category as much as possible. 


Figure 10	
Tool Matrix Filled 
 
Note. This figure shows the results of the case study. Solid indicates strong data quality, hatched indicates weak data quality. Blank indicates no data.


	Figure 8 shows the results of the case study for what type of information can be collected using each resource. 
For Google Earth, all types of information were able to be collected except the artifact of a 3D model. Google allows users to print aerial imagery directly out of Google Earth as part of its free licensing. However, they prevent the download or distribution of the 3D photogrammetry model for access. While there are workarounds to this, they are legally dubious and ethically questionable, not to mention unusable for professional work. Contour data can be collected using the path feature built into the free Pro software, as a slope along a transect. Above-ground utilities can be seen in aerial imagery with some success. Objects, buildings, and vegetation can all be seen in the aerial imagery as well. Allowing for a decent collection of data about the site using Google Earth.
GIS data is dependent on location. Some cities, counties, and states have a more complete collection, and some have a less comprehensive or accurate collection of data. For the site of this study, there was a 2018 Tupelo USGS survey dataset that included several of the data types needed for this study. Aerial imagery was collected through an open street-map plugin for QGIS with free licensing copyright. A DEM (digital elevation model) was included in the 2018 Tupelo that contained highly accurate contour and slope information. The city of Starkville does not have utilities mapped in a GIS format for the site of this study. Objects are also not included in any data set available for the site. Mississippi does have a building footprint shapefile for the entire state that was able to be accessed. Vegetation was able to be collected based on the aerial imagery with some success. 
Two different online vendors were able to provide a range of data and artifacts. Nearmap and Topoexport were used together to gather aerial imagery, 3D models, contours, utilities, buildings, and vegetation. Objects were able to be identified from the aerial imagery with limited and incomplete success. Each online vendor has its own licensing rules and regulations, allowing the data to be collected for professional work. 
Using a DJI Mavic 2 pro, all different types of data and artifacts were able to be collected for the site of this study. Using Pix4d capture, a free application for iOS and Android, the site was flown in a double grid pattern to take a series of aerial photographs. These aerial photographs were then stitched together in Pix4Dmapper, a professional desktop subscription-based software, to generate a high-quality aerial image and a 3D model. The process uses Photogrammetry to stitch a series of geo-referenced photographs into a single artifact. This is accomplished by taking overlapping points on the site and using them as anchoring points for the stitching. 
Because of this process, the site was flown multiple times to test the process as well as ensure the most accurate photographs were collected. This resulted in a high-quality aerial image and 3D model that included contours, above-ground utilities, objects, buildings, and vegetation. 
The professional survey was provided by the city of Starkville, courtesy of Dewberry, an engineering and surveying contractor with offices across the southeast. The survey includes all types of data analyzed in this study: contours, utilities, objects, buildings, and vegetation, as well as providing a 3D contour model of the site. The professional survey does not include an aerial image of the site. This is the only artifact missing from the survey. 

Comparative analysis 

A comparative analysis was conducted of the professional survey to understand Acura's information collected through each method. Due to the lack of aerial imagery in the professional survey, the analysis focused on the data categories rather than the artifacts. Each category of data was plotted and measured against the survey, as well as the other resources used. For each resource, the survey was held as a constant plotted in black, while the resources were plotted and color-coded: Google Earth – Red, GIS – Green, Online Vendor – Tan, and UAV – Blue.

Contour and sectional data analysis


Figure 11	
Contour Plots
 
Note. This figure shows contour plots. 
Legend: GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


For contour data, only the UAV, GIS, and the online vendor were able to provide actual contour lines in the 2d top-down perspective. These lines are off by a margin of feet in reference to the survey, and as such, provide a very different-looking contour drawing of the site. However, the contour lines - while different in location - are more accurate when taken as sectional guides. By drawing a section through the site and using the intersection points of the contours to draw a section, the accuracy of the information can be analyzed with much greater precision. Additionally, when we include these section lines, we are also able to include the other two resources that provide topographic information. Slope information shows a different story of the accuracy of each resource.


Figure 12	
Section Plots
 
Note. This figure shows section transects. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red, area of difference = 546.7 sf. GIS – Green, area of difference = 51.2 sf. Online Vendor – Tan, area of difference = 139.3 sf. UAV – Blue, area of difference = 73.5 sf. Professional Survey – Gray.


Using section transects allowed for the calculation of the area between the resources and the professional survey. This was done by creating a surface between each section line and the survey and then finding its area in square feet.
Google Earth data - plotted in red - provides a very basic understanding of the topography of the site. This information is very imprecise, failing to account for any of the site-specific slope information and averaging more than a 3’ deviation from the slope signature of the professional survey. The area between the section lines was 546.7 sf.
GIS data - plotted in green - provides a highly detailed and accurate section cut through the site. The GIS section contains a high degree of consistency to the survey, never differing by more than 6” throughout the site and averaging 3”. There is a decrease in accuracy off the eastern side of the section just outside of the site boundary. Here, the difference increases to 10”. The area between the sections for GIS was 51.2 sf.
For the online vendor Topoexport, plotted in tan, the sectional information is also quite imprecise. Throughout the site, there is little to no variation on the section line, showing site-specific topographical information. On average, the slope is more than 10” off up to 1’-7” at the most. The area between the sections is 139.3 sf.
UAVs collected sectional information has a high level of detail, and site-specific topographical information is included. In the western edge of the site, the road as well as the two drainage swales are visible, the depth of the latter being no more than 6 inches. The overall accuracy of the section is quite high, with an average error of 2” on the west side. However, on the east side, the Information warps up and averages 1’=5” of difference. The area between sections is 73.5 sf.

Utilities

For the comparison of utilities on site, only the above-ground utilities can be accurately located, as this is due to the method of analysis. For each resource, the aerial imagery was studied, and the location of utilities was plotted. 


Figure 13	
Utilities Plots
 
Note. This figure shows above ground utilities. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


Google Earth utility data is decently inaccurate at locating above-ground utilities, in this case, primarily power lines. This is due to the quality of the aerial imagery and the time at which it was captured. The foliage on the trees and the low pixel resolution work to obscure utilities. This leads to a poor understanding of how the utilities on the site run. The location of power line poles is wildly inaccurate, ranging from 2’-6” off to 109’-2”. This makes it incredibly hard to accurately identify utilities for this site. However, with the use of Google Earth street-view many of the more outstanding inaccuracies can be corrected. The location of streetlights is much more accurate, with the maximum difference being 7” off. 
GIS data is less accurate for identifying utilities on this site due to the lack of a city or county dataset. The aerial imagery was used to identify the utilities, but with the aerial imagery having a lower pixel resolution than Google Earth, the information was more incomplete. None of the streetlights were identified, and the locations of the power line poles were more inaccurate, with the closest being 7’-8” off. It also failed to show one pole entirely, which shapes the perception of the site. 
Nearmap offers a much higher pixel resolution aerial image that is more up to date, allowing for a better identification of the utilities on site. Using Nearmap allowed for the correct location of all power line poles as well as streetlights. The accuracy of the information was also a significant increase from the other method, with the farthest distance being 8’-8” and the closest being 6”. The closest of which was close enough that the margin of error fits within the diameter of the poles themselves. This accuracy allows for a much more precise understanding of the utilities on site.
UAV data was the most accurate overall. The aerial imagery allowed for a highly accurate identification of power line poles and street light locations. This was in part due to the timing of the aerial being during the winter, when vegetation did not get in the way, as well as the very high-quality pixel resolution. The farthest difference was 7’-2” while the closet was only 2” off. UAV data allowed for a highly precise understanding of the above-ground utilities on site and provided accurate locations. 

Objects

For the comparison of objects on the site, the aerial imagery was observed for all resources. These images are one of the only ways to gain an understanding of specific site features such as parking pads, fences, and walkways. For the site of this study, several features show up depending on the resources you use to analyze it. 


Figure 14	
Objects Plots
 
Note. This figure shows on site objects. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


Google Earth shows a collection of objects and site features that would accompany the houses located on the site. At the east end of the site is a wooden fence used for privacy from the public insurance lot across the line. Just west of this is a walkway between two buildings at an obtuse angle. It also shows a rather large parking pad that services the site, as well as a gravel pull-off on the corner.. Also indicated on the site is a shed and a series of steps rising from the sidewalk to the level of the front house. This information is decently accurate according to the Google Earth imagery and 3D model. However, these features no longer exist on the site. They have since been removed as part of a new construction project. Here, the Google Earth information is inaccurate and misleading for an understanding of the. Current site conditions.
GIS data is no more helpful than the Google Earth information. Neither the city nor the county possesses a dataset of objects or features found on site, and therefore, the only information to go off of is that of the aerial. Here, the aerial used from open topography is also out of date and low enough resolution that identifying site objects and features is difficult. The information that is seen is mostly the same as that of Google Earth, with slight differences in precise location. Notably, the fence is impossible to identify.
Nearmap shows a much more accurate and up-to-date set of objects and features on site. The location of street curbs and sidewalks is significantly more accurate and clear on using the online vendor than in either Google Earth or GIS. Nearmap clearly shows the location of the site steps and the gravel pull-off, as well as the location of the other features, which have been removed. Additionally, Nearmap shows the location of a silt fence on site that has been installed as part of the construction process. The information provided in this up-to-date and high-resolution aerial is significantly more useful and accurate than any of the resources used so far. 
The information included on the UAV aerial is more complete than that of Nearmap. While Nearmap identifies the location of the silt fence and the site steps, the UAV aerial also indicates the locations of several chunks of concrete left on site during the demolition. It also locates the steps, the silt fence, and the gravel pull-off with a higher degree of precision in relation to the professional survey than Nearmap. UAV-based object and site feature information proves to be the most accurate measure used in this study. 
Note: The information included in the UAV aerial of leftover concrete sections and the location of the silt fence are over and above the information included in the professional survey. The existence of these features and their location were verified through onsite measurements and site visits. The UAV aerial imagery, therefore, is more precise and accurate at showcasing the existing site conditions than the professional survey is for this study. 

Buildings 

Building information is a critical aspect of understanding a site, and as such, was a major focus of this study. The comparison used a combination of aerial imagery, 3D models, and dataset information available. 


Figure 15	
Buildings Plots
 
Note. This figure shows the footprints of buildings. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


Google Earth information includes the location of three buildings on the site, two houses, and a detached garage structure. The two houses are located towards the front of the property, facing University Drive. The detached garage structure is on the eastern side of the property, in the back, sheltered underneath several trees. The location of an insurance building on the next property over is also indicated. There are also several buildings on adjacent properties and across the street that are included in the aerial. The location of the insurance building is mostly accurate according to the survey; however, it is shifted to the west by 4’. The location of the buildings on site is not accurate to the survey, as them having been removed since the aerial was captured. 
The state of Mississippi does possess a statewide dataset of building footprints that is freely available to the public. This dataset shows the location of the three buildings on site, as well as the insurance buildings and several buildings on adjacent properties. The accuracy of the information is general and has an orientation issue; buildings are rotated 6 degrees from the correct orientation. Additionally, the existence of the buildings on site makes the dataset inaccurate regarding the current conditions. However, the location of the insurance buildings is highly accurate, with the difference only being off by 6”. 
Nearmap Topoexporter both show the locations of buildings, with Nearmap being more accurate to the existing conditions and locations. Nearmap does not show three buildings on the site but does indicate the locations of the buildings on adjacent properties. The location of the insurance building is the most inaccurate, with it being off by 4’-7”. However, both the correct angle and the lack of buildings on the site make it more reliable than either Google Earth or the GIS dataset, both of which falsely represent the current conditions. 
Building data acquired from the UAV is more precise than that of Nearmap, with the insurance building only being off by 3’-2”. The UAV data is also more accurate to the current conditions than Google Earth or GIS, with a clearer representation of the current state of the site. Buildings located off the site are less accurate than the other resources due to their lying outside the gridded flight path. This results in warping and problems when it comes to stitching the images together. Because of the 3D model that is also included with the UAV, an understanding of the materiality of the buildings, as well as an accurate height, can be captured. This is also true for Google Earth, although the precision is less than that of the UAV. 
Overall, the most accurate to the current conditions is the data from the UAV, however, it is less precise about the building location than the GIS data. Which is more accurate, but not up to date with the current construction work happening on the site. The least accurate is Google Earth, with Nearmap in the middle. 

Vegetation

Vegetation data on the site is largely the location of tree trunks, with a lack of shrubs and lower ground cover. This data was also based largely on the aerial, with some reliance on the 3D models where applicable. The survey identifies 8 trees and one area of hardwood brush. 


Figure 16	
Vegetation Plots
 
Note. This figure shows tree locations. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


Google Earth tree data is hard to acquire based on the aerial imagery of the site. The imagery was captured in the summer with full foliage, making it hard to properly see where the trunks of each tree are located. Because of this, the information is imprecise and variable depending on who is conducting the study. Google Earth properly identifies the number of trees on the site as 8. However, their locations are quite inaccurate, and no indication of trunk size is possible. The most accurate tree is off by 2’-1” while the most inaccurate is off by 47’-2”. This highlights the large variance of data collected from the aerial. 2 trees are not identified at all, with the hardwood brush being identified as 2 trees. This is inaccurate and misleading compared to the existing conditions. 
GIS only identifies 6 trees on the site. While none of the trees identified are as far off as that of Google Earth, the complete omission of 2 trees and the hardwood brush makes it less reliable or accurate. The farthest off location is 32’-9” and the closest is 3’-6”. This data is drawn from the aerial because neither the city of Starkville nor Oktibbeha County has a tree census. This makes the data less reliable altogether. 
Nearmap identifies 7 of the trees on site with more accuracy for those listed than either of the two previous resources. The closest is 9” off and the farthest is 11’-8”. This is significantly more accurate and precise; however, the hardwood brush is identified as a tree, and the easternmost and southernmost trees are unaccounted for. While a new tree is identified in the northeast corner that does not exist on site. While this resource is more reliable than the others so far, it is still misrepresenting the site in important ways that undermine the accuracy of the analysis.
UAV aerial imagery and 3D model identify 9 trees on site. When compared to the survey, this is the most precise resource for locating existing trees on site, with the most accurate distance being 1’-3” and the least being 6’-3”. So, the range is smaller and more consistently accurate to the survey, even though it does not have the most accurate location out of all the resources. It also indicates a 9th tree on the eastern side of the site that does not exist in reality and is misleading. The hardwood brush is completely unobserved in the UAV vegetation data. 
Each of these methods of collecting vegetation data is specific to the time and the season when the imagery of the data is collected to determine the accuracy. One of the reasons that the UAV data was more precise than the other was that it was collected in the winter, allowing for a better observation of the trunks of the trees than the data collected in summer. Different sites would vary depending on the time of the data collection.

Cross-resource comparison

The second case study analysis method that was used was cross-resource comparison. For this, each artifact was compared laterally between resources to understand the differences between them more effectively. This comparison focused on the aerial imagery and the 3D model captured using each resource. Here, the understanding was made that GIS only serves to analyze other types of data, and therefore, the lateral comparison focuses only on three of the resources: Google Earth, Online Vendors, and UAVs.

Aerial Imagery
The first artifact that was compared was aerial imagery. Here, the images were compared based on several criteria, including pixel resolution, date of capture, visual clarity, and usefulness.  


Figure 17	
Aerial Collage
 
Note. This figure shows the aerial images of Google Earth, Nearmap, and the UAV spliced together. Difference in resolution and clarity are of note.


The above figure shows the aerials of Google Earth, Nearmap, and UAV lined up in comparison to each other across the site. There is a clear progression across the site as well as across the resources as the resolution, date of capture, and visual clarity increase from left to right. Google Earth aerial has a published resolution between 45 and 60 am/px. This is not an accurate measure, though, due to the projection used by Google Earth in representation as well as the overall size of the site changing the pixel count per cm, when measured the actual pixel count per real-world foot was 50 cm/px. This is a much more helpful measure to use in comparison to the other aerial images. 
Nearmap publishes a pixel per cm resolution ranging between 4.4 and 7.5, depending on location. This is dependent on the tool used to capture data, as well as the time of capture, with technology continually improving. For this study, the actual pixel cm resolution found was 5.2. Which is significantly better than the resolution of Google Earth. This leads to increased visual clarity and a better understanding of the site. 
The pixel cm resolution of a UAV-generated aerial image is highly dependent on the setting used during the flight. Any change in the height, angle, overlap, or speed can affect a change in the final resolution. This flight was flown at 40m with 80% front overlap, 70% side overlap, -60 degree camera angle, and a speed of 2.7 m/s. This resulted in a resolution of 1.08 cm/px. Which is a significant improvement from the other two resources. This not only leads to an increase in visual clarity but also precision. 


Figure 18	
Aerial Collage, Dated
 
Note. This figure shows the aerial imagery of Google Earth, Nearmap, and the UAV for the same location on the site. Visual clarity of objects is displayed.


The data of capture of each resource also plays a critical role in determining the importance of an aerial image for site analysis. Seen in Figure 16, the data of capture increases similarly to the resolution, with Google Earth having the oldest date and the UAV having the newest date.
Google Earth does not have a published update frequency that I can find, but states that for urban areas, imagery might update every few months, while rural areas might be several years old. The general average they indicate is 1-3 years for updating imagery. For this study, the date of capture of the information is November 13th, 2016, 9 years 9-year-old 
Nearmap claims to update its imagery often but doesn't set any firm expectations. The site has been covered twice by direct Nearmap data, once in 2022 and once in 2024. The 2024 flight was on December 2nd. This is two months before the study was conducted. 
The UAV is a tool that can be used to capture data whenever the project is underway. Because it is a portable and deployable tool, the site data can be as current as needed. This aerial was captured on February 3rd, 2025, during this study. Therefore, it was the most up-to-date information that existed on the site when captured. 
Both the resolution and the data make an aerial image much more accurate for analysis and information. The ability of the UAV to capture higher quality data when needed is insurmountable. While Google Earth does a decent job of mapping the site, its lack of resolution and failure to be up to date leaves it as a weak site analysis resource. Nearmap is a more accurate and precise option but still has limitations when compared to the data of a UAV. 

3D Model

The second artifact that was laterally compared was the 3D model. Three model artifacts were collected during this study. Online vendor Topoexport creates a model of the site for free, in addition to offering more features for a price. The UAV-generated model of the site using Pix4D photogrammetry software includes material information. The 3D model is included in the professional survey. 

Figure 19	
Model Comparison
 
Note. This figure shows 3D models from the professional survey, Topoexport, and the UAV.


The model given in the professional survey is a simple CAD model. It consists of 2d vector lines with the contours including a vertical measurement. This results in a very clean line model that contains only the information that can be communicated through CAD lines. The 3D spatial qualities of the model are precise to the existing conditions without creating any surfaces or meshes. Therefore, to create a concept model for rendering and graphical representation, the model must be built on top of the survey. Thereby ensuring that the information is located correctly but constructing all of the solids and surfaces oneself. 
The model captured by Topoexport is a solid object model. Unlike the professional survey it supplies the surfaces and solid objects as such, however, the model is of relatively low quality. The accuracy of the information is less than ideal and rather generic. There is no indication of materials, and the topography of the model is generalized, eliminating the site-specific grading that a site model needs for a Landscape Architecture analysis. Vegetation and vertical structures other than buildings are also missing from the model, making it less helpful overall.
UAV-generated 3D models are constructed using photogrammetry and, as such, use a series of images. These images include information about the materials of the surfaces as well as the locations of above ground objects and vegetation. For the site of this study, the model data accurately locates the insurance building on the adjacent lot as well as the location of the steps on site and the slope of the cemetery across the street. The model contains surfaces and solid objects as well as a topography mesh that accurately matches that of the professional survey’s contour lines. This adds up to a highly detailed and informative 3D model artifact that can be imported into a program of choice for manipulation.
There are some limitations to Photogrammetry workflows. As seen in the literature, models constructed through photogrammetry fail to distinguish between dense low ground cover and actual topography. While this was not an issue for this study due to the nature of the vegetation on site, this can cause major disruptions to accuracy and precision. Additionally, the triangulation method used to construct meshes can make the “first person” view of a photogrammetry model disjointed and less than helpful. Both complications depend on UAV settings and site conditions to mitigate and provide accurate data.  


Overall Comparison 

Taking these comparisons into account and analyzing them for overall accuracy creates a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. Figure 2.4.1 shows the overall placements of each resource in relation to the professional survey as well as laterally to each other resource. The results for this study show that there is a clear progression from less to more precise resources as you move across the top from left to right.

Figure 20	
Results Matrix
 
Note. This figure shows results of the case study measured for precision to the professional survey compared by category. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.


Aerial imagery is the main category of analysis that does not include data from the professional survey. This makes it unique among the other categories. Here, GIS ranks the lowest of the resources used in the study. The imagery available from OpenStreetMap was out of date, and also the lowest in resolution. This made the data collected from it less accurate and more misleading. Google Earth ranks just slightly above GIS, thanks to the resolution of the aerial imagery being higher. However, it suffers from the same problems as GIS. Nearmap is much more reliable and accurate, falling in the middle of the line for comparison. Resolution of the imagery and the more current capture date make it a much more reliable resource than the previous two. There are still major differences between the information portrayed in the aerial versus what currently exists on the site. This is made clear when looking at the UAV-generated aerial. Because there is no professional survey aerial, the most accurate and precise resource for capturing an aerial image of the site was the UAV. The resolution was higher, and the data was more current than any other resource tested, which led to a significantly improved understanding of the site conditions.
3D model data was largely unhelpful from the online vendors, with the topography and the materiality being both imprecise and inaccurate. It did provide a base to be added to and worked with, moving onto the design and concept stages of a project; however, as a tool for understanding the conditions of the site, it is unhelpful. The model captured with the UAV was very helpful in understanding the site, and incredibly accurate to the conditions of the professional survey. Topographic information contained in the 3D model is within 6” of accuracy to the professional survey across the area of the site, with a slight warping occurring around the edges of the model. Additionally, the model contains the rendered materiality of the site, allowing a better understanding of what might cause differences in elevation change. The location of tree trunks and other objects is seen on site, making it consistent with the information found in the professional survey. 
Contour information was best measured in slope across a section line. Here, the least accurate resource was Google Earth. The overall slope of the site was indicated, but no site-specific details were discernible. Section cut lines in Google Earth are not created with a high enough degree of measurement to compare with the other resources. Online Vendor topoexport provided slope information, but it also lacked the level of detail needed to be precise for the survey. Therefore, it is not a great tool for understanding the site conditions during research and analysis. The section taken from the UAV model is significantly more accurate to the site, including road sections visible and headstones of graves on the adjacent lot. However, due to warping of the model around the edge, the precision is less reliable than that of the 2018 USGS Tupelo DEM found in GIS. This was the most accurate to the professional survey, only straying by a matter of inches at any given point. 
Above-ground utilities were able to be identified for all resources used in the study, but some were more or less accurate at reflecting the existing conditions on site. The lack of a dataset and the low quality of the aerial imagery left GIS as the least helpful tool for inventorying above-ground utilities. Google Earth is slightly more reliable as a resource because of its increased resolution on aerial imagery, but it fails to reflect the current conditions, making it a poorly equipped tool for analysis. Both Nearmap and the UAV are much better equipped to analyze above-ground utilities, with the main difference between them being the slightly better resolution of the UAV. However, both tools are accurate and updated enough to be a valuable tool for above-ground utilities analysis.
Object analysis and documentation is overall a much higher category for each of the resources used, ranking as either the highest or next highest for each resource.
Google Maps does a good job when it comes to location and identifying objects and structures on the site. This is in part because of the resolution, while not the highest, being high enough to identify the larger objects. The major markdown for it is once again the lack of updated information. Nearmap is much more accurate to the existing conditions while providing more information about the objects on site. It is also more up-to-date and therefore accurately reflects the location of the silt fence and the front steps without showing the parking pad that has been removed. UAV data is once again the most accurate for the professional survey by locating the steps and the gravel parking pull-off most accurately. It is also the easiest to identify information due to the high level of resolution that makes it an enjoyable experience to look at.
Building identification is separated into two categories, with Google and GIS falling to the bottom while Nearmap and UAVs rise to the top. The location of buildings on site is out of date, with the first two making it an unreliable method of analysis. While the latter two are more reliable, showing only the building around the site, matching the information shown on the professional survey. Although none of the resources are accurate enough to make the survey obsolete. This can be seen with even the best resource being off by 3’.
Vegetation is the most challenging category of comparison between the resources due to the changing season affecting the information that can be observed. Here, the most accurate resource for locating tree trunks is the UAV. However, understanding the canopy and the shading of the trees is lacking in the UAV analysis due to the time it was conducted. Here the Nearmap offers a better opinion. Google Earth and GIS data are less helpful in this metric because of how they obscure the most important information.


Figure 21	
Accuracy Bars
 
Note. This figure shows the range of precision of each resource measured against the professional survey. 
Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.

In Figure 19, we can see the range of precision of each resource used in this study. Holding the professional survey constant as the most precise form of measurement, we can understand where the others fall along this scale. GIS is the most diverse resource for site analysis. When there is information about a site available, GIS can be the most accurate tool. When there isn't available data about the site, the precision is very low or non-existent. For this study, GIS was both the most precise information for section data and the least precise information for above-ground utilities. 
Google Earth and Maps are overall the least precise resources for gathering data about the site. From the low resolution of the aerial imagery to having the oldest date of collection, it was routinely inaccurate and inconsistent with site conditions. In every category of comparison, Google Earth was less precise than another resource and far enough off from the professional survey to require significant changes. 
Online vendors also offered a decent range of precision, with Nearmap offering high-quality aerial imagery and accompanying it. However, Topoexport was not nearly as accurate or precise when it came to the 3D model of the data that came from it. Overall, the information depended on the specific vendor used and the price they charged for the data and artifacts. 
The UAV was consistently the most precise referenced against the professional survey. Artifacts and data collected by UAV were consistently either the most or the second most precise information analyzed in this study. The aerial information is the most accurate artifact available, considering that the professional survey did not provide one. Objects were also located with as much accuracy as the professional survey and included some debris on site that the survey left out. UAV was clearly the most accurate and precise resource overall included in this study.

Barriers of site analysis resources 

Several barriers need to be addressed when talking about the usefulness of each resource for site analysis. These barriers are contributing factors to the results. Not only do they shape access to these resources, but they also shape the quality of data. Three main barriers will be addressed here: Cost, Time, and Knowledge.

Cost
The price of each resource is a determining factor when deciding which resource to use for site analysis. The most preferred price is no price at all. Two resources fall into this category. Google Earth is a free-to-use resource. There is no purchase or subscription needed to gather the data that I gathered in this study. This makes it one of the most accessible resources that exists for site analysis and understanding. GIS is a collection of data, and different tools exist for working with that data. This study used QGIS. QGIS is a free and open-source program available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The data collected in this study were also free, gathered primarily from MARIS, with some data gathered from USGS repositories. This allowed the GIS analysis of this study to be conducted without cost. 
The next range is that of the low to high cost resources. These are the online vendors, ArcGIS Pro, and UAV. Online vendors vary in cost depending on the type and amount of data you capture, most offer a free trial or a free option for an amount of data. To use online vendors in the long term, though, a pay-per-use or subscription model is needed. This study used Nearmap for imagery and Topoexport for the 3D model data. Nearmap is a subscription model that ranges from $1,500 to $212,000 annually, depending on the services desired. Topoexport offers free downloads under 50 km². Beyond that, the price increases on a subscription plan of either $39 or $99 a month, per user. ArcGIS - the paid professional GIS software - operates on a subscription model. There are different tiers available, but the price ranges from $700/yr to 4,200/yr.
The UAV is a DJI Mavic 2 Pro, which costs $1,449 at the time of purchase. Currently, as of April 21, 20,25, this model is no longer available for purchase in the United States. The software that was used to post-process the imagery is Pix4Dmapper, which is a subscription model costing $291/month. 


Table 3	
Resource Cost
Resource	Cost Description
Google Earth	Free
QGIS + MARIS/USGS	Free (QGIS + free public data from MARIS/USGS)
Nearmap	Subscription: $1,500 – $212,000/year
Topoexport	Free under 50 km², then $39 or $99/month
ArcGIS Pro	Subscription: $700 – $4,200/year
UAV (DJI Mavic 2 Pro + Pix4Dmapper)	Hardware: $1,449 (discontinued) + Pix4Dmapper: $291/month


Time
The second barrier to each resource is the time it takes to gather the data and artifacts from it. This is an important step in evaluating the usefulness of each one. Google Earth is the fastest, with immediate access to artifacts through a website or downloadable program. This places it as the most accessible resource of those tested. Online vendors offer a close second place, with most offering immediate access once an account has been set up. This first step adds some time to the front end, but once established, it offers no more friction than Google Earth. For some features, such as the 3D mode, a small processing time is required, but it takes no more than 5 minutes. 
GIS is the middle range, depending on the type of data being collected and the location of the site. The tools - QGIS and ArcGIS Pro - are programs that require download, with ArcGIS Pro requiring an active subscription account. The time taken to collect the data varies, but it often takes somewhere in the range of 30 minutes to a few hours once the programs are installed. This accounts for searching and downloading shapefiles from online databases. 
UAV is the most time-consuming resource for site analysis. Not only does it require traveling to the site and flying the programmed route, but the images must be processed in post. This can take a couple of hours of automated running time on a dedicated machine. Due to this, the total time it takes to use a UAV is highly variable on a case-by-case basis. The flight for this study took 3 minutes to conduct. The processing time took 31 minutes of generation and 2 hours of stitching. This makes the UAV the slowest and most time-consuming resource for site analysis.

Online Vendors	Near-immediate after account setup, 3D model processing < 5 mins
QGIS + MARIS/USGS	30 minutes to several hours, depending on the data source and location
ArcGIS Pro	30 minutes to several hours, including subscription setup
UAV (DJI Mavic 2 Pro + Pix4Dmapper)	Highly variable – site visit, flight (3 min), 31 min generation, 2 hrs stitching


Knowledge
The knowledge required to use each of the resources studied also acts as a barrier to their adoption. Google Earth and online vendors offer the easiest interfaces in an attempt to be more user-friendly. These resources are intuitive and web-hosted with helpful descriptions and tutorial walkthroughs on the site. This streamlines the knowledge requirements for these resources and places them as the most user-friendly. Requirements for using them include internet access and the ability to find a print button. 
GIS is much more involved and requires more knowledge to use. Different applications for GIS software range in requirements from medium difficulty to more difficulty, depending on the analysis you are conducting. For this study, a more advanced knowledge of QGIS was required to gather the topographical information and the sectional data. 
UAV knowledge requirements are the most demanding of the resources used in this study. Not only are there more advanced software requirements for Pix4Dmapper and Pix4DCapture, but the software used to analyze the output requires a higher knowledge base. Additionally, and most importantly, the UAV requires a Remote Pilot license issued by the FAA for commercial use. This requires passing a written test covering information from weather to section charts. FAA requirements for Remote Pilots are rigorous to maintain safety of all individuals by ensuring safe operating conditions for all flights. Because of this there is a very high knowledge base required for UAVs.

Legend: Google Earth – Red. GIS – Green. Online Vendor – Tan. UAV – Blue. Professional Survey – Gray.

Figure 20 shows the overall combined barrier ranges for each resource analyzed in this study. Google Earth is the easiest resource to pick up and use at no cost, with minimal time, and with next to no special knowledge requirements. Online vendors fall slightly above this with varying but typically low costs, minimal time requirements, and low special knowledge. GIS is the broadest range, depending on the type of analysis used. Depending on the tool used, cost is either none or high, time is more involved and takes longer, and the knowledge requirement is decently high. UAV has the most barriers with a decently high entry cost, a large time commitment, and requires passing a special knowledge test proctored by the government. 

 
CHAPTER IV
DISCUSSION
Intro
Based on the information gathered in the previous section, several key insights are revealed. No single resource offers every benefit without cost. UAVs are the most accurate and precise, while at the same time costing the most and requiring the most specialized knowledge. Google Earth is the most accessible, free and easy to use, but it offers low accuracy and imprecise data. Each resource offers distinct advantages over the others, but none provides all of the best results. 
Attempting to rank these resources is unhelpful, as it fails to account for specialization. The best thing to do is to look at the whole range of analysis and decide that best fits each specific circumstance. Choosing a tool or a resource always involves cost-value analysis. This study is no different. There are value attributes for each resource as well as costs. This aligns with the literature, each resources has strengths and weaknesses. So, what do we do with this information? We must develop strategies that adapt to each resource, the site, and the desired analytical needs.

Multi-resource workflow
Unified site analysis workflows better incorporate the strengths and weaknesses of each resource, covering gaps and improving site understanding. Each resource in this study becomes a tool in the landscape architect’s bag, to be used when most helpful. Tools are the programs and resources that we turn to when we encounter a task. This also aligns with the best practices laid out in the literature, not only by duplicating information but by layering and incorporating systems thinking into the process of inventory. In the same way that building a house requires more than just a hammer, analyzing a site requires more than just Google Earth. 

Initial research and site analysis
Projects progress from less precise to more precise; as this process takes place, the tool best suited for the project changes. At the beginning of a project, a professional survey is disproportionate to the level of precision and accuracy needed, working to slow the process down in the details, at a stage where moving fast and visioning is more appropriate. Here, Google Earth is the best tool for the job. The level of access and time required make it the ideal tool for the first stages of understanding a site. Information such as the location of the site in a broader context, overall vegetation coverage, and road access can be understood at a glance. In less than five minutes, a basic understanding of the site is acquired without needing to travel to it. 
Most projects benefit from the use of Google Earth as the first tool used in understanding the site. All its advantages come into play while its disadvantages are mitigated. The low barriers of Google Earth allow for a solid understanding without overinvestment on the front end. Lack of precision and accuracy in the existing conditions can be rectified at a later stage without causing problems with the progression of the project. As the project moves from infancy to maturity, understanding likewise progresses in accuracy. Google Earth analysis sets the stage for further understanding. Site conditions are observed and marked for further inquiry later. Next steps are conducted in one of two ways: comprehensive remote analysis or refinement of site conditions. 
Comprehensive remote analysis is best conducted in GIS. The ability to gather regional information and ecological conditions while requiring only medium time and knowledge positions GIS as the best tool to progress understanding in this way. GIS allows for an in-depth regional analysis that pairs well with the basic understanding of Google Earth to help flesh out the site analysis. Layering of information creates better base information and more thorough cross-referencing. It does so while pushing the project forward in both accuracy and precision, requiring more extensive knowledge and greater time commitment. 
Refinement of site conditions is best accomplished by an on-site visit. This visit allows for the referencing of features and data available on Google Earth with accurate existing conditions. All the while helping refine and discover discrepancies in remote information. The best resource to pair with a site visit is easily the UAV. This tool allows for the recording of accurate, timely, and highly precise existing conditions. Not only for on-site referencing with previous data, but also for future work as the project requirements progress. 
UAVs bridge the gap between professional surveys and Google Earth, reducing discrepancies and increasing understanding. This is critical as a project moves from initial conceptual phases to schematic design and design development phases. The accuracy of the data provided by UAVs minimizes the adjustments that are required in changing a design from a Google Earth driven concept to real real-world proposal. This saves valuable time and resources for both the client and the firm, more than making up for the cost of the UAV at this stage of the project. 
This structure both aligns and departs from the literature. While comprehensive remote analysis and professional survey grade applications for UAVs and GIS fit in with the findings in the literature, Google Earth as an early-stage research tool departs. Google Earth is not seen as a noteworthy resource in most literature due to the errors and lack of precision, however, this study suggests otherwise. 

Conceptual Design
Once a site has been researched and analyzed, the design can start to come together. As noted in the literature, having the accurate artifacts created by the UAV is invaluable. Not only do they provide detailed bases to start layering on, but the precision of the professional survey minimizes late-stage change orders or realignments. This allows designers to move forward with a greater degree of speed and confidence, knowing that as the project progresses, there will not be any major setbacks.
Additionally, the detailed base information allows projects to be pushed farther, quicker. Levels of refinement and feasibility that would traditionally take weeks can now be incorporated directly into the design process from the beginning. Exercises like area calculations, material takeoffs, texture analysis, and other vital spatial processes all benefit. This enhances workflow efficiency and design consistency. 
The Design process is heavily dependent on understanding scale. Sizing, proportioning, and locating are all substantially impacted by scale. This leads many designers to own engineering scales and pens and pencils of different weights; this increases perception and competency in handling the site. However, with the infinite canvas that most CAD software uses, and the real-world measurements of UAV data, maintaining scale understanding is also enhanced. 
Using the detailed base information gathered from Google Earth, GIS, and UAVs significantly shortens the modeling and drawing time of a project. This allows landscape architects to spend more time and effort focusing on the actual design rather than the back-end production. Clients benefit from enhanced designs, lower costs, and more accurate representations when multi-resource workflows are employed in the design phase. This study extends the discussion of UAV incorporation into design and construction workflows, by demonstrating their precision and efficiency. 

Construction Documentation 
For projects that progress to bidding or construction, a professional survey must be conducted. Not only is this due to the accuracy of the data, but it is also needed for the professional stamp. Professional surveys provide the legal responsibility and liability required for construction permitting.  As such, design projects must base their measurements on the professional survey for precision. This is true for all construction documents.
Even so, throughout the project, the artifacts and data gathered in the beginning continue to improve and inform the design. GIS analysis continues to enhance understanding of off-site conditions, leading to more impactful design decisions. UAV images inform decisions with critical site information, reducing costly time sinks. Those images and artifacts also continue to inform graphical representations of the project, like renders, making it more attractive to clients and the general public. 

Precision vs. Usefulness
It is also necessary to talk not just about the quantitative precision as compared to the professional survey, but also about the usefulness of each resource to the designer. Here, we must consider slightly different categories of comparison. While the professional survey offers the most accurate measurements of the site, it fails to include an aerial image. This leaves it far less useful to the designer than Google Earth for laying out a plan. There is minimal to no information on the ground cover, the shade paths, the way water runs, or the view sheds. The professional survey also fails to provide any information beyond the boundaries of the site. Ecosystems hardly ever operate at the scale of a single site, as noted abundantly in the literature, leaving a professional survey incomplete without observing the bigger picture. 
This type of information is critical to designers and positions many of the resources of this study as more beneficial for landscape architects than the professional survey. Design relies heavily on the visual aspects of analysis, and as such, any of the resources that provide visual information, as well as site data, make themselves more valuable. Google Earth street view and on-site visits are significantly more informative to a landscape architect than CAD, regardless of the accuracy. These resources naturally lend themselves to higher use, which is why in the survey questionnaire, Google Earth received the most responses. 
UAVs fit naturally into this category. With an emphasis on location and imagery, UAVs naturally lend themselves to usefulness in landscape architectural site analysis. While some forms of data and information about a site struggle to give a comprehensive understanding, pictures and images of the site continue to offer a wealth of information. Not only at the time of initial analysis, but afterwards as well. UAVs operate by taking a series of aerial images and using them in several ways to create additional artifacts. Because of this, however, the very method used to capture UAV data makes them incredibly valuable.
The final artifacts that are created by the UAV contain image material-mapping. This increases its usefulness by itself; however, the original photographs are also available for reference. This means that a proper UAV site analysis not only provides accurate and information-rich final artifacts but also a comprehensive series of images covering the entire site. These two sets of visual information are critical for designers and analysts. 

To Climb a Tree
UAVs offer a unique perspective of the landscape. As seen in the literature this perspective is between that of the satellite and the human. This unique perspective shifts the phenomenological experience of a site in ways that we are not used to. One of the few ways to gain this perspective, prior to the UAV, was to climb a tree. The desire to gain height and see out is ingrained in us and should not be ignored. As designers, we are in constant need of improved site perspectives. The opportunity offered to us by UAVs is one we should embrace as yet another tool for our workflows.

Tools Used vs. Best Tool
Another major topic of discussion indicated in this research is workflow alignment. Not only does this thesis study the technical capabilities of these resources, but it also focuses on current uses. How are practicing professionals currently utilizing and employing the resources included in this study? The survey questionnaire revealed current use patterns not only of resources in general, but also, applications of those resources. The case study revealed the strengths and weaknesses of each resource. Cross analysis of these datasets allows us to understand where improvements can be made immediately. 
Google Earth is the most widely used resource, as indicated in the study. It is also the most consistently inaccurate. Respondents indicated that the major use of Google Earth was aerial imagery. The case study, however, revealed that the aerial imagery from Google Earth was the second most inaccurate, and often might be the worst depending on the site. This indicates that most people are disproportionately using inaccurate resources. This discrepancy is concerning given the high reliance on Google Earth despite its low accuracy. It is the most used resource for understanding a site. Likewise, respondents indicated that building footprint data is a critical point of analysis for Google Earth, while the case study demonstrated that it is acutely inaccurate.
Meanwhile, the most accurate resource for aerial imagery - the UAV - is being used by less than 30% of respondents. This indicates a gap between what is accurate and what is used. This pattern holds for other categories of analysis. Out of the respondents who use GIS, the most important category indicated is utilities. In the case study, GIS is the least accurate resource for utility data. Consistently, this study demonstrates that the most accurate resource is not the most widely used. This reveals an opportunity for educators to focus on realigning this discrepancy, while also addressing a gap in the literature between research and practice.
There are some categories where there is better alignment. Contour data ranks second for GIS, and it is the most accurate resource. Likewise, out of the respondents who use Nearmap and UAVs, they indicated the aerial imagery as the most important artifact, which aligns with their strengths. This also holds in other categories of analysis for UAVs and GIS, with respondents valuing data that they can provide.
Overall, this study indicates that there is no strong relation between accuracy and use. Survey questionnaire responses have little relation to the accuracy of a resource at entry levels. When accounting for the level of specialized knowledge, however, there does seem to be some relation. Although more research is needed to confirm this. As the requirement for specialized knowledge increases, respondents' use of accurate data and artifacts also increases. This seems to indicate that the more specialized knowledge a landscape architect acquires, the more likely they are to use resources that provide precise data. 
There is a strong correlation between the barriers to a resource and its adoption. As the barriers increase, use decreases. This aligns with what one might expect on the subject. However, there seem to be some outliers to this. Online vendors, although they have low barriers, are not used as often as would be expected. Nearmap provides accurate artifacts and data while having low barriers, yet it is not used by many respondents. While Nearmap has low barriers, not many landscape architects are familiar with it. This suggests that both barriers and knowledge restrict the adoption of a resource. 

Final Notes
This study finds that a multi-resource workflow is the best approach to site analysis. Doing so leverages the advantages of each resource while mitigating the disadvantages. Precision is necessary for the development of construction documents, but not as important for design analysis. Not all valuable information can be documented quantitatively. A broader understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of site analysis resources should be worked towards. Landscape architects should understand the best tools for each task and apply them appropriately.

Limitations of the study methods 
This study contains several limitations. Both the location and size of the site create limitations on the data that can be collected. This impacts the results of each resource. GIS suffers in this study, being in a rural area. Google Earth also suffers from less frequent image updates. These factors potentially weight results in favor of the UAV and online vendors. 
This Study focuses on a single site for analysis. This creates challenges for creating a thorough comparison. With the focus of a single site, some resources might not demonstrate strengths or weaknesses that would show up with a larger study.
The methods used in this study provide limitations for the accuracy of the data. As the researcher, my understanding of the site improved throughout the process in ways I was unable to forget. This potential weighed the results for the resources that were studied last in the process, artificially increasing their respective accuracy.
The artifacts used to gather data, specifically utility data, only allow for above-ground understanding. The professional survey provides information about underground utilities that none of the other resources can.
The UAV workflow used in this study does not have LiDAR capabilities. This limits the accuracy of the data captured and leaves a gap in the study. The use of photogrammetry alone fails to provide a full analysis of UAV abilities. 
Additionally, the sample size of the survey questionnaire was small, failing to provide a more reliable statistical analysis. This potentially shaped the results of the survey in ways that artificially inflated some responses.


 
CHAPTER V
CONCLUSION

How can UAVs improve site analysis workflows for small landscape architecture firms?

Small landscape architecture firms benefit from the adoption of UAVs into their workflows. UAVs enhance the accuracy and the speed of site analysis. Artifacts generated through UAV-enriched workflows provide improved base material for designs, elevated site understanding, and inform more targeted analysis. However, UAVs do not provide unhindered benefits. Implementing UAVs into workflows requires high upfront and recurring costs, dedicated machine processing time, and specialized knowledge. 
Based on this information, a multi-resource workflow is best suited to incorporate UAVs. Doing so maximizes the strengths of each resource while mitigating or minimizing its weaknesses. Moving from low-barrier, general information to high-barrier, specific information mirrors the development of a project. Aligning these processes creates a greater impact while streamlining workflow efficiency. Progressing from Google Earth to GIS to UAVs creates a strong framework for site analysis.
UAVs also fit seamlessly into the experiential and subject site documentation process. Imaging capabilities and the “birds’ eye” view allow for yet another scale of site understanding. This scale fills a valuable phenomenological gap between the abstraction of the satellite and the entrenchment of the human eye. This new perspective creates unique opportunities for site analysis and perception, enriching the research of a landscape architect. 

Regulations, education, and cost currently limit the adoption of UAVs on a broader scale. However, as technology improves and costs fall, access to UAVs will only increase. Therefore, education on UAV capabilities and workflow opportunities is critical in improving the workflows of small landscape architecture firms. 
Moving forward, schools of landscape architecture would benefit from integrating instruction on UAV capabilities and developing targeted landscape architecture UAV workflows for specific projects. These workflows create a strong base of knowledge for the students and faculty, not only benefiting the department but also impacting alumni and future employers. In this way, professors understand current technologies, students gain practical lifelong skills that make them more impactful, and the profession grows more robust as a result.

 
CHAPTER VI
FUTURE WORK
	This study answers a prescient and timely question dedicated to advancing the profession. However, it unearths more questions than it answers. These questions open opportunities for future work focused on a deeper understanding of nuances in UAVs.

How do UAV settings and photogrammetry software affect the precision of the data? 

Carrying out the same methodology on multiple flights with different capture settings builds a framework for understanding UAV best practice. Work would be done iteratively, duplicating data for verification. Additionally, the use of LiDAR could be studied to understand the material benefit of object-penetrating LiDAR for landscape architectural workflows.

How does scale affect the results of this study? 

Carrying out the same methodology on sites of different scales would be able to either verify or refute this study's findings. Sites would be selected with attention to size, terrain, objects, and vegetation. This work would further the understanding of UAVs in typical site conditions encountered in the profession.

How does flight layering change the quality of the data? 

Operating multiple flights from the same location with different focuses creates the opportunity to understand the manual layering of information. Flights would be designed to cover missing data to overlap all available inventory. This work would study automated layering with manual control points to create more varied information systems.

How does firm size affect the resources used in site analysis? 

Future work could also expand on the findings of the survey questionnaire. Focusing on how firm size affects site analysis resources. Further questionnaires would be developed and sent out as follow-ups to the data collected in this study.

How does pedagogical adoption affect student work?

Future work could also look at how student adoption of UAV workflows affects final project designs. Studio classes would be divided into UAV and non-UAV sections to understand how design progress is either enhanced or inhibited. Final designs and a follow-up questionnaire could help create understanding about student workflows.

Letter to Chapter Presidents

Dear Chapter President 

I am reaching out to you to ask for your assistance with a research project that I am conducting as a master's student in Landscape Architecture at Mississippi State University. 

My name is Bryant Baugus and I am conducting a research project focused on the application of UAVs in professional design. The goal of the study is to understand the material benefit of utilizing UAV-generated site data in a professional setting. 

The research consists of two parts, with the first being a brief survey of current professionals’ tools and workflows. The region of the study is focused on the Southeastern United States. 

I am seeking your assistance in distributing this survey to the ASLA members in your chapter. If you would be willing to assist me in distributing the survey, please forward the following letter to the members of your ALSA chapter.
